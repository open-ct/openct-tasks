           <p>The collision between the robot <b>1</b> and the robot <b>2</b> can only take place on the intersection of their trajectories.</p>
           <img src="sol_easy_1.png">
           <p>We start by moving the robot <b>2</b> until this point of collision. Then we move the robot <b>1</b> until it crashes into the robot <b>2</b>.</p>

         <div class="medium">
           <p>If we bring the robot first <b>2</b> to the point of collision of the two robots, then advance the robot <b>1</b>, then this one will be stuck in front of the robot <b>2</b> and will not move forward. Indeed, the instruction in step 1 indicates that if there is a robot in front of it go to step 3, and the execution of step 3 returns to step 1.</p>
           <img src="sol_medium_0.png" style="width:650px">

           <p>We must therefore proceed differently. First bring the robot <b>1</b> to the point of collision. We execute the instruction of step 1 at a time when the robot <b>1</b> has nothing in front of him. So, the robot <b>1</b> is ready to perform Step 2, which consists of moving forward without asking any questions. </p>

           <p>We can then bring the robot <b>2</b> at the collision point, then perform a step for the robot <b>1</b> in order to advance it on the robot <b>2</b>.</p>
