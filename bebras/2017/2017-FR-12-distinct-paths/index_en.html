              <p>In summary, here are the 3 possible paths.</p>

           <div class="medium" id="img-medium">
              <p>To start, either we go down, or we go to the right. If we go down, we can go right, but we are stuck, because there is no path through the two boxes marked with a red cross.</p>

              <p>So, you have to go three times to the right. Then we have no choice we must come back. We arrive at the situation below.</p>

              <p>From there, there are 2 other possible paths.</p>

         <h2>It's computer science !</h2>
   
            <p>This challenge proposes to practice a <b> exhaustive exploration </b> of paths, optimized with an <b> early detection of dead branches </b>, which corresponds to noticing at certain moments that we will inevitably be stuck and there is no point in continuing.

            <p>Many computer algorithms exploit this strategy, better known as <b> branch and bound </b>. This strategy applies very well to quickly find valid solutions in problems where the number of possibilities is potentially gigantic, but it is in fact relatively easy to evaluate if a beginning of solution is inevitably doomed to failure.</p>
